ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
I graduated in Geomatic Engineering in 2021 from UNESP in Brazil. Over the years, I had the opportunity to study and learn more about Photogrammetry, Topography, Geodesy, Cartography and, of course, Remote Sensing and Geoprocessing, which has been my area of specialization. 
I always had an interest in science, but I only discovered Data Science in my master's degree, where I've been working with Machine Learning for the classification of orbital images. Nowadays, I'm learning resources to be a data scientist, and my all improvement I'll share here.
